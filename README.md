<h3>Capturing with Tcpdump (Fundamentals Lab)</h3>

<h4>Scenario</h4>
As the new network administrator for the Corporation, we have been tasked with capturing some network traffic to help baseline and validate the Corporation's network. As a test, we start utilizing tcpdump to get a small capture of our local broadcast domain traffic to ensure our capture device will work to accomplish this task. We need to ensure the tools and dependencies required are installed and test our ability to read traffic and capture it to a file.

Task 1: Validate Tcpdump is installed on our machine:
